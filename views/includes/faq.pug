  h1 Frequently Asked Questions: 
  h3 How do I delete my ad?
  p When you create your ad, an email will be sent to the email provided giving you the option
    |  to delete the ad from there. But in case that method does not work for you,
    strong  all ads automatically expire one month from the post date.
    
  h3 Does Motospot handle things like processing payments, rental agreements, ect..?
  p Motospot does not process payments or offer any legal services such as rental agreements. We simply offer a platform to connect landlords with tenants (think 
    a(href='https://craigslist.org') craigslist
    | ). Things like
    |  processing payments, collecting payments, rental agreements, ect... are all responsibilites that the landlord
    |  must handle on their own.
